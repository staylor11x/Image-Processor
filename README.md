# Image-Processor
Python script that can perform basic image processing tasks such as blur and sharpen.

The repo contains two different scripts, one which performs the sharpening and blurring via a kernel and the other performs the operations via a (faster) FFT transform algorithm.

Please note that these algorithms are NOT fully optimised. The purpose was to develop a solution that shows how these processes work, without the use of pre-existing python libraries such as opencv.
